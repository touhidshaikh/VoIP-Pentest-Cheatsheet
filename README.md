# VoIP Penetration Testing Cheat Sheet

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) refers to the technology that allows individuals to make voice calls over the internet. It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and reliability compared to traditional phone systems.
Penetration testing, also known as "pen testing," is the practice of simulating an attack on a computer system, network, or web application to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. It is an important aspect of network security and helps organizations ensure that their systems are secure and resistant to cyber-attacks.

**Here is an example of a VoIP penetration testing process:**
- Planning and scoping: The first step in a pen test is to define the scope and objectives of the test. This includes identifying the target systems, the types of attacks to be simulated, and the level of access that the tester will have.
- Reconnaissance: The tester will gather information about the target systems and their vulnerabilities through various methods such as network scanning, social engineering, and website crawling.
- Vulnerability analysis: The tester will use specialized tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities in the target systems, including software vulnerabilities, misconfigured systems, and weak passwords.
- Exploitation: The tester will attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain access to the target systems and test their security measures.
- Post-exploitation: If the tester is able to gain access to the target systems, they will assess the level of access and determine what sensitive information, if any, they are able to access.
- Reporting: The tester will document their findings and provide a report to the organization outlining the vulnerabilities discovered and recommendations for remediation.

It is important to note that penetration testing should only be conducted with the permission of the organization owning the target systems and with the appropriate safeguards in place to prevent damage to the systems being tested.

**Here are some examples of vulnerabilities that could be identified during a VoIP penetration test:**
- Weak passwords: VoIP systems often rely on passwords to authenticate users and protect sensitive information. If these passwords are weak or easily guessable, it could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- Unsecured communication channels: VoIP calls are transmitted over the internet, and if the communication channels are not properly secured, it could allow an attacker to intercept and modify the call data.
- Unpatched software: VoIP systems often run on software that is prone to vulnerabilities. If the system is not kept up to date with the latest patches and updates, it could leave the system open to attack.
- Misconfigured systems: Incorrectly configured systems, such as firewall rules or access controls, could allow an attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the system

By conducting regular penetration tests, organizations can identify and address vulnerabilities in their VoIP systems, helping to ensure the security and reliability of their communication systems.

### Reconnaissance and Enumeration
Enumerate entire implementation, The devices connected to the VoIP network, their open ports, and running services users information (extension, the device information, and logs).

In this phase, also concentrate on finding extensions and usernames/passwords for users across the VoIP network. The main focus of this phase is to find your way(s) in. Utilizing who and how someone uses the VoIP is key when trying to get in.
And many more questions also below,
- What types of phones are in use?
- Who makes them?
- Model of devices?
- Where is the SIP Server implemented?
- Whatâ€™s the software in use?
- Are they using TCP or UDP for traffic?
- Are they sending it through secure means?
- What are their IPs and what other ports are open on these devices? etc.
These are all questions that need to be answered during the initial phase of the VoIP assessment and pentest.

### Attacks against VoIP
In this phase, Let's focus to identify the security vulnerability on the implementation of the VoIP according to our organization standard and know standards.

### Strategic Mitigation
In this phase, we retest the vulnerabilities whether they fixed not and also try to bypass the current mitigation to reverify the mitigation is properly implemented.

### VoIP Penetration Testing Lab

- [VULNVOIP](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hacklab-vulnvoip,40/) - VulnVoIP is based on a relatively old AsteriskNOW distribution and has a number of weaknesses. The aim is to locate VoIP users, crack their passwords and gain access to the Support account voicemail.
